# Parallel matrix multiplication
Task 1: Implement a parallel version of blocked matrix multiplication by OpenMP
Task 2: Implement SUMMA algorithm by MPI
Task 3: Implement Cannonâ€™s algorithm by MPI


Each task have two variants of implementation.
The code for Tasks 1-4 can accept external testcase input files. For example, Task1 accept following command line:
```
Task1 <num_threads> <input_testcase_filename> <output_filename>
```
